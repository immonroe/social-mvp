# Product Requirements Document: Pinterest-Style Image Board App

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for building a Pinterest-style MVP application where users can create accounts, upload images, organize them into boards/collections, and browse their saved content. The app will focus on core functionality to enable rapid testing and iteration, hosted on V0 with a Supabase backend and Next.js frontend.

The primary goal is to create a functional image organization platform that allows users to collect, categorize, and browse visual content in an intuitive, Pinterest-like interface.

## Goals

1. **Enable Core Image Management**: Users can upload images from their devices and organize them into named boards
2. **Provide Flexible Authentication**: Support both full account creation and demo account access for immediate testing
3. **Create Intuitive Organization**: Users can create multiple boards and easily save images to appropriate collections
4. **Ensure Cross-Platform Usability**: Deliver a responsive experience that works well on both mobile and desktop devices
5. **Establish Foundation for Growth**: Build with Supabase integration that can scale and support future feature additions

## User Stories

**As a new user**, I want to quickly access the app with a demo account so that I can explore the functionality without commitment.

**As a registered user**, I want to upload images from my device so that I can build my personal collection of visual inspiration.

**As an organizing user**, I want to create named boards (like "Home Decor Ideas" or "Recipe Inspiration") so that I can categorize my saved images logically.

**As a content collector**, I want to save uploaded images to specific boards so that I can easily find them later.

**As a browsing user**, I want to view my boards and the images within them so that I can revisit my saved content.

**As a mobile user**, I want the app to work smoothly on my phone so that I can save inspiration on the go.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Social Features**: No user-to-user interactions, following, or public content browsing
- **Advanced Search**: No search functionality across boards or images
- **Image Editing**: No built-in image editing or filtering capabilities
- **Collaboration**: No board sharing or collaborative editing features
- **External Integrations**: No importing from other platforms or social media
- **Advanced Privacy Controls**: No granular privacy settings beyond basic user isolation
- **Comments or Annotations**: No ability to add comments or notes to pins
- **Bulk Operations**: No bulk upload, move, or delete operations
- **Advanced Board Organization**: No nested folders, tags, or advanced categorization
- **Analytics or Insights**: No usage analytics or content insights

## Design Considerations

- **Visual Style**: Clean, modern interface inspired by Pinterest's grid layout and card-based design
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring usability across all device sizes
- **Loading States**: Clear indicators when images are uploading or loading
- **Empty States**: Helpful messaging and calls-to-action when boards or the app are empty
- **Navigation**: Intuitive breadcrumb or back navigation between boards and main view
- **Image Display**: Masonry or grid layout that showcases images effectively
- **Touch-Friendly**: Buttons and interactive elements sized appropriately for mobile use

## Technical Considerations

- **Supabase Integration**: Utilize Supabase Auth for user management, PostgreSQL for data storage, and Storage for image files
- **Image Optimization**: Implement image compression and thumbnail generation for performance
- **File Upload**: Handle file size limits and provide clear feedback during upload process
- **Database Schema**: Design efficient tables for users, boards, images, and the many-to-many relationship between boards and images
- **Security**: Implement Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase to ensure users can only access their own content
- **Performance**: Lazy loading for images and efficient queries to handle growing content libraries
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network issues, upload failures, and edge cases

## Success Metrics

- **Core Functionality**: 100% of users can successfully complete the flow: create account/use demo → upload image → create board → save image to board
- **User Engagement**: Users create an average of 3+ boards and upload 10+ images during their first session
- **Technical Performance**: Image uploads complete within 5 seconds for files under 5MB
- **Cross-Platform Usage**: App functions without errors on both mobile and desktop browsers
- **User Retention**: Users return to add more content after their initial session

## Open Questions

1. **Image Size Limits**: What maximum file size should we enforce for uploads? (Suggested: 10MB)
2. **Demo Account Data**: Should the demo account be pre-populated with sample boards and images?
3. **Board Limits**: Should there be any limits on the number of boards a user can create?
4. **Image Metadata**: Do we need to store any metadata like upload date, file size, or original filename?
5. **Error Recovery**: How should we handle partial upload failures or network interruptions?
6. **Future Scaling**: Any anticipated features that should influence the initial database design?
